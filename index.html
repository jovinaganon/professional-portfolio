			<h2 id="subHeader1">About me</h2>
			<p id="bioText">Growing up as a kid, I loved playing games on a computer and I still do now. But before I started playing games, I learned how to use a computer on my own. At first, I started out surfing the web by watching videos on YouTube and searching for some cheat codes for my games. But then it led to messing with different features, playing with code of different programs, and eventually researching what makes a computer work and how it's able to do so. Every time I used it, I discovered something new about the computer like what its components are and what it's capable of doing with many lines of code. From then on, my curiosity only grew and I knew I wanted to do something with them in the future. Today, I'm a Web Design senior at Southwest CTA who still has that passion and curiosity as well as the aspiration to be a Computer Scientist/Engineer.</p>
